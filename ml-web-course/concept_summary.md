# ML Concepts

## Basic Project Structuring

### Environment Management

- Virtual environments - pyenv, .venv
- Package Management - Pip, Conda, Brew
- IDEs - VSCode to Jupyter
- Docker - Environments in a Container

### Environment Setup

- Requirement files
- Environment files - Sensitive Matters
- Scripted workflows - Basic shell scripting and Make

## Data Management

### Flat Files

- CSV vs Parquet vs Text, pros and cons
- Reading Static Files into Memory - Pandas, Spark and other techniques

### Data Over a Network

- RestAPI Data Providers
- Website Data Scraping - Structured and Unstructured

### Querying Relational Data

- Types of SQL Services - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite and Commercial Tools
- SQL Basics - SELECT FROM WHERE HAVING GROUP ORDER
- SQL Level 2 - Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions
- SQL Integration - Parameterized Queries; Connecting from Code

### Database Administration

- Starting a Database Instance: Dockerized Postgres and PGAdmin
- SQLite: Local lightweight alternative
